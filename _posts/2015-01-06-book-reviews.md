My goal is to read at least ten books every year, and I fell just short in 2015. However, I read some really great books and wanted to write a short review for each one. 

## Shades of Grey by Jasper Fforde (NOT FIFTY SHADES)

Shades of Grey the best book I read this year, and is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy books I've read in a long time. I got the recommendation from an old co-worker (thank you @obriieane) and I can't thank her enough. It's an incredible book, and I literally lost sleep over it because I couldn't put it down at night.

The universe that Jasper Fforde created is deeply intriguing. It’s hard for me to describe, but I think I can best describe my feelings when reading the book as overwhelming curiosity. The universe is so unique and interesting, and the plot unfolds in a way that makes it hard to put down. The book also has an excellent sense of humor and absurdity, in the same vein as Terry Pratchett.

The only bad thing I have to say about this book is that the sequel is not out yet. His website says book two is due in 2016, my fingers are crossed.

## Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut

I watched the movie Adaptation earlier this year and absolutely loved it. After watching it I started reading discussions about it. I stumbled upon a thread about other examples where an author writes themselves into a story. Slaughterhouse Five came up, and I decided to re-read it because I love Vonnegut and when I read the book in highschool it didn't have much of an impact on me. 

> A moment went by, and then every cell in Billy’s body shook him with ravenous gratitude and applause.

It’s not my favorite Vonnegut book, but it's still very good. I think what I missed back when I read it back in highschool is how depressing and real the book is. Right after finishing book something interesting happened. I was talking to some old highschool friends about a mutual friend of ours that had literally gone crazy since high school. A lot of his descriptions fit the main character’s (like being obsessed with an obscure sci-fi author) and it made the book that much more real and sad.

On a less personal note, Vonnegut's writing is, as always, extremely freakin good. The way he packs so much punch into so few words makes this book (and all his books) a great read. I'm going through my highlights and popular highlights and it's hard to pick because there are so many good ones. 

> They were adored by the Germans, who thought they were exactly what Englishmen ought to be. They made war look stylish and reasonable, and fun.

> I have this disease late at night sometimes, involving alcohol and the telephone.

> All this responsibility at such an early age made her a bitchy flibbertigibbet.

## Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari

Aziz! I picked this pick up after watching Master of None (great show). As a single 28 year old, this book was easy to relate to and eye opening. Mixed with Aziz's sense of humor, it makes for a fun and interesting read. 

He goes over some topics that hit close to home. The one that stuck with me the most is the idea of "I need the best". Apparently I'm not the only one that puts WAY too much research into where I want to go out to eat. This idea affects relationships in the sense that a lot of people (myself included) feel like they can't settle for anyone:

>Remember: We are no longer the generation of the “good enough” marriage. We are now looking for our soul mates.

This effect is amplified when you introduce technologies like Tinder, Match, and even Facebook. The amount of choices we have is almost scary and can be overwhelming. It's not all bad, of course. Having a larger pool to choose from means we don't have to settle for an OK relationship.

Aziz’s discussion on this topic and many others is pretty fascinating. He often contrasts our current situation to our parent’s generation and exposes many of the bad conventions and traditions we have when it comes to relationships. 

## Stay Awhile and Listen by David Craddock

I can’t remember how I discovered this book, but it’s a nonfiction book about the development of PC game Diablo.

The writing in this book isn’t the best. In fact, I’d even say it’s not good. However, if you are a fan of Diablo, or you like hearing stories about insanely tough software development projects, you should check out this book. The content is great.

## Nexus by Ramez Naam

This was a book that John Carmack recommend on Twitter. And when John Carmack speaks, I listen. To give a short and stupid description, Nexus is a sci-fi book where people can write software that hooks up to their brains. To give an example of how this works, early in the book the protagonist loads an 'alpha male' persona into his brain and uses it at a party to pick up chicks. Every nerd’s dream.

The problem with brain software is that many people and organizations want to be the only ones that have it. Various governments and powerful organizations get involved, with the protagonist being a person of interest because he’s one of the most advanced in the field.

It’s a pretty good read, although I haven’t picked up the second or third books yet.

## The Martian by Andy Weir

Do I even need to review this? It’s a really good book. It has tons of cool science, the main character is hilarious, and the plot is exciting. I haven’t seen the movie yet, but when you read this book you just KNOW it’s gonna make an awesome movie.

## The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim

This was recommended to me by my two coworkers, who also happen to be our company’s biggest devops evangelists. 

This was a really interesting read for me because I didn’t really know what devops was. I had heard the term a lot, and had a vague idea of what it was. But if someone asked me, “what is devops?” I wouldn’t be able to give a clear answer.

It’s written like a story, which was really refreshing. It made it a quick read, and made understanding the concepts easier. Certain characters in the book were almost exact matches of people I work with. 

The big takeaway from this book is almost obvious in a way: it’s of utmost importance to invest in improving process. As a software developer I’m all too familiar with the pain of running into process slowing me down when all I really want to do is just write some dang code. This idea isn’t new, but it shines a big light on an often overlooked aspect of software development.

I think this idea applies to other areas of life as well. After reading this book it motivated me to clean my office, because I realized I didn’t like to work in there because it was messy. By cleaning my office I just improved my work process! 

## Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson

About a week after I finished reading this book, I saw articles about another Steve Jobs biography coming out written by a different author. Many of Steve’s closest friends and co-workers denounced this biography and endorsed the new one. Pretty shitty feeling because this book is HUGE. 

Either way, even though Jony Ive doesn’t approve this biography I still thought it was good. It’s always interesting to get a behind the scenes look at people we idolize and a company whose products have become so influential and ubiquitous. Before reading this book I often read stories about Steve Job's personality, so it was interesting to get an in-depth look at what he was really like, and what experiences made him into the person that he was.
