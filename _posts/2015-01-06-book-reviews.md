My goal is to read at least ten books every year, and I fell just short in 2015. Despite that, I read some really great books and wanted to get my thoughts and review about each one. 

## Shades of Grey by Jasper Fforde (NOT FIFTY SHADES)

Shades of Grey is my favorite book I read this year, and is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy books I've read in a long time. I got the recommendation from an old co-worker (thank you @obreianne) and can't thank her enough. It's an incredible book, and lost sleep over it because I couldn't put it down at night. 

I can't remember the last time I got sucked into a fantasy universe

## Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut

I watched the movie Adaptation earlier this year and absolutely loved it. After watching it I started reading discussions about it, and read about other examples where an author writes themselves into a book. Slaughterhouse Five came up, and I decided to re-read it because I love Vonnegut and when I read the book back in highschool it didn't have much of an impact on me at all.

Far from my favorite Vonnegut book, but still extremely good. I think what I missed back when I read it back in highschool is how depressing and real the book is. What was really interesting was that I was talking to some old highschool friends about a particular mutual friend of ours that had literally gone crazy since highschool. A lot of his descriptions fit the main characters (like being obsessed with an obscure sci-fi author) and it made the book that much more real and sad.
