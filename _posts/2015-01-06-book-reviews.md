My goal is to read at least ten books every year, and I fell just short in 2015. Despite that, I read some really great books and wanted to get my thoughts and review about each one. 

## Shades of Grey by Jasper Fforde (NOT FIFTY SHADES)

Shades of Grey is my favorite book I read this year, and is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy books I've read in a long time. I got the recommendation from an old co-worker (thank you @obriieane) and can't thank her enough. It's an incredible book, and I literally lost sleep over it because I couldn't put it down at night. 

The universe that Jasper Fforde is incredibly intriguing. My mind was overcome by curiosity and excitment over where the book would go next. The book is also incredibly funny and absurd, in a way that reminds of Terry Pratchett.

The only bad part of this book is that the sequel is not out yet. His website says book two is due in 2016, fingers are crossed.

## Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut

I watched the movie Adaptation earlier this year and absolutely loved it. After watching it I started reading discussions about it, and read about other examples where an author writes themselves into a book. Slaughterhouse Five came up, and I decided to re-read it because I love Vonnegut and when I read the book back in highschool it didn't have much of an impact on me.

Far from my favorite Vonnegut book, but still extremely good. I think what I missed back when I read it back in highschool is how depressing and real the book is. What was really interesting was that I was talking to some old highschool friends about a particular mutual friend of ours that had literally gone crazy since highschool. A lot of his descriptions fit the main characters (like being obsessed with an obscure sci-fi author) and it made the book that much more real and sad.

On a less personal note, Vonnegut's writing is, as always, extremely freakin good. The way he packs so much punch into so few words makes this book (and all his books) a great read. I'm going through my highlights and popular highlights and it's hard to pick because there are so many good ones.
