The other day, I told my coworker that I weigh the amount of food I prepare for lunch every day. He understandably thought I was crazy, so I've been thinking about why I do it and why I think it's something that everyone could benefit from.

I was also listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast with Seth Godin and how he recommends blogging everyday. I don't think I'm going to blog every day, but the part that really resonated with me was that it's beneficial to write something, in public, that you stand behind. I often lack confidence expressing opinions and ideas when I shouldn't, I think writing more blog posts will help.

## Calorie enlightenment

My food weighing journey all starts with tracking calories. It's a pain in the ass and it's imprecise, but nothing has been more useful and eye-opening than tracking my caloric intake. I calculated how many calories I wanted to eat a day, and started tracking what I ate using MyFitnessPal. 

The lesson was immediate, as I entered in an extra tablespoon of peanut butter or teaspoon of mayonnaise. A tablespoon of peanut butter is about 100 calories, which isn't exactly trivial. When I compared gulping down a tablespoon of peanut butter and running on a treadmill for 10 minutes, my priorities were quickly rearranged.

Eating out soon became an exercise in futility as I learned that there is almost nowhere to eat a meal that fits my macronutrient needs. 

Let me just say that I am truly a fat kid at heart. I LOVE food, and it showed until I was in highschool and got my ass in gear. Eating my heart out at Chipotle is one of my favorite ways to reward myself.
